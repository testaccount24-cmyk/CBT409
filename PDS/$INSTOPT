CHANGING GLOBAL OPTIONS
=======================

Associated members in this dataset :

o $INSTOPT  - This member
o $ASMOPT   - Sample JCL to assemble and link the MXI global options

There are a few global options that can be changed in both the MXI
base load module and the MXI server.

(o) The DSCB collection setting
(o) The ability to hide menu choices that the user is not authorised to
    execute.
(o) The seconds that MXI waits for an operator command response when
    using the '/' command.
(o) Whether or not the ZAP command causes a WTOR to be issued asking for
    confirmation.
(o) Whether or not certain commands cause an audit message to be written
    to the SYSLOG.
(o) The TCP/IP port number that is to be used by the MXI server address
    spaces.
(o) The maximum number of lines possible on an MXI display.
(o) The maximum number of LLA modules that can be tracked.
(o) Whether enqueues are displayed on the DA display for a single ASID.
(o) The timeout limit for remote requests.
(o) The default MQ series subsystem name.
(o) The default DB2 subsystem name.
(o) Whether or not MXI can start the DB2 MONITOR1 trace.
(o) The default queue name mask for the MQQ command.
(o) Whether or not MXI invokes any cross memory services.

The global options that can be defined to MXI take the format of a
sequence of keywords for the MXIGOPTS assembler macro. This must be
assembled and linked into the MXI and MXISERV load modules to replace
the supplied defaults.

The statement is very easy to code and does not require any extensive
knowledge of the assembler language. All you need to remember is to
specify a continuation character in column 72 and start the continued
line in column 16 and to separate each keyword by a comma.

                   XMEM=(YES/NO)
                   PORT=nnnnn

Keywords   : DSCB=(ON/OFF)
--------        Specifies the global default setting for DSCB
                collection. This setting affects the APF, LINK and
                LPA commands.
                The default setting is OFF.

           : MENUHIDE=(ON/OFF)
                Specifies whether commands that the user is not
                authorized to use appear on the primary option
                menu.
                The default setting is ON.

           : DAENQ=(ON/OFF)
                Specifies whether enqueues are listed on the DA display
                for a single address space. In complex GRS environments
                there can be a large overhead in displaying the enqueues
                and this setting allows this to be avoided.
                The default setting is ON.

           : EMCSWAIT=nn
                Specifies the maximum number of seconds to wait for
                a response to an operator command ('/').
                The default setting is 5 seconds.

           : EMCSFILL=nn
                Specifies the number of seconds to wait for the
                EMCS message buffer to fill after the expiration
                of the EMCSWAIT value. A value higher than 1 will
                improve the chance of capturing all of the output
                from commands that produce a high volume of
                messages at the cost of a slower response time.
                The default setting is 1 second.

           : TIMEOUT=mmss
                Specifies the timeout value (mm = mins, ss = secs)
                for remote requests. All four digits MUST be
                specified including leading zeros.
                The default setting is 60 seconds = 0060.

           : MAXROWS=nnnnn
                Specifies the maximum number of lines displayed
                on a single MXI display. Any value below 1000 or
                over 99999 is ignored.
                The default setting is 40000.

           : WTORZAP=(ON/OFF)
                Specifies whether a conformation WTOR is issued
                when the ZAP command is used.
                The default setting is ON.

           : MSGMAKE=(ON/OFF)
                Specifies whether a audit message is issued when a
                user issues the 'MAKE' command.
                The default setting is OFF.

           : MSGOPER=(ON/OFF)
                Specifies whether a audit message is issued when a
                user issues the '/' command.
                The default setting is OFF.

           : LLAMODS=nnnn
                Specifies the maximum number of LLA modules that
                are tracked via the MXILLIX1 exit.
                Any value lower than 100 or higher than 9999 is
                ignored.
                The default setting is 5000.

           : LLASMF=(NO/nnn)
                Specifies the SMF record number to be used to record
                the LLA modules statistics in CSVLLIX1. The SMF
                record appends the LLP1 parameter list to a standard
                SMF record header - see the MXSMFREC macro.
                If you do not require SMF records to be written,
                then specify 'NO'.
                The default setting is NO.

           : LOGRRECS=nnnn
                Specifies the maximum number of log streams that
                are recorded from the SMF 88-1 records captured
                by the MXIU83 exit.
                Any value lower than 100 or higher than 9999 is
                ignored.
                The default setting is 1000.

           : LOGRRLEN=280
                Specifies the length of a SMF 88-1 record. This
                option should not be changed unless IBM change
                the length of the SMF record.

           : CA1PWD=(ON/OFF)
                Specifies whether the CA-1 password is shown on the
                CA1 command display.
                The default setting is ON.

           : MQ=cccc
                Specifies the default MQ Series subsystem name.
                The default setting is 'CSQ1'.

           : DB=cccc
                Specifies the default DB2 subsystem name.
                The default setting is 'DSN1'.

           : DB2MON1=(YES/NO)
                Specifies whether MXI can automatically start the
                DB2 MONITOR1 trace when using DBxx commands.
                The default setting is YES.

           : DEFMQQ
                Specifies the default queue name mask for the MQQ
                command (1 to 48 chars).
                The default setting is '*'.

           : XMEM=(YES/NO)
                Specifies whether MXI can perform cross-memory
                services for certain authorised commands. This
                includes scheduling SRBs into another address
                space or using AR Mode methods.
                This setting only applies when MXI is running
                in authorised mode.
                The default setting is YES.

           : PORT=nnnnn
                Specifies the port number used by the MXI TCP/IP
                server. This value must be common to all systems
                that run the MXI TCP/IP server and must not be
                shared with any other software.
                The default value is 8001.

Please refer to the supplied member $ASMOPT that contains the JCL to
assemble and link the options into MXI and MXISERV.

Make the changes that you require and submit the job which should
finish with a return code of 0.
