!Function
+  Displays the statistics for each DB2 buffer pool
+
!Command Syntax
+ @DBBP namemask DB(sub)
+
!Keywords      +
  @namemask    +An optional masking pattern that can be used to filter the
               +displayed list on all or part of the buffer pool name.
               +The default value is '*'.
               +The wildcard character of '*' and a placeholder character of '%'
               +can be used.
  @DB(sub)     +Direct the DBBP command to use the 'sub' DB2 subsystem.
+
+
!Examples
+ @BP BP32K*         +List all buffer pools that start 'BP32K'
+ @BP DB(DSN2)       +List all buffer pools from the DSN2 subsystem.
