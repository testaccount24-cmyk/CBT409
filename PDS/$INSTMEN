CUSTOMISING THE MENU COMMAND MENU
=================================

Associated members in this dataset :

o $INSTMEN  - This member
o $ASMMENU  - Sample JCL to assemble and link the sample MXI command
              menu.
o MXIMENU   - MXI Macro that defines the MXI command menu
o MXIMEN00  - Sample MXI command menu. This is the source to the
              default MXIMEN00 shipped with MXI.

Creating The MXI Command Menu
=============================

The MXI command menu defined to MXI takes the format of a sequence
of assembler statements that use the MXIMENU macro. These statements
must be assembled and linked into a load library that is available to
MXI. The resultant load module is of the form : MXIMENxx where 'xx' is
a user defined two-character suffix. Note that currently MXI only supports
the suffix of '00'.

The statements are very easy to code and does not require any extensive
knowledge of the assembler language.

Defining the start of the command menu
--------------------------------------

The first non-comment statement in the command menu member must be
in the following format :

   MXIMENU START,SUFFIX=xx

This statement is used to assign the suffix to the MXIMENxx member and
provide an anchor reference for later statements.

For example, if you are defining the default menu MXIMEN00, then this
statement should be :

   MXIMENU START,SUFFIX=00


Note : Currently only SUFFIX=00 is supported.


Defining the command menu choices
---------------------------------

The syntax of the statement to define a menu choice is as follows :

   MXIMENU SET,
         COMMAND=command,
         GROUP=group,
         KEYWORDS='keywords',
         AUTH=NO/YES,
         COMMENT='comment'

Keywords
--------

   COMMAND=command
      Specifies the MXI command verb, max length 4 characters.

   GROUP=group
      Specifies a user defined command group. This group can be used to collect
      MXI commands into smaller submenus using the ONLY() and NOT() keywords
      on the MENU command. This group can be any 1 to 8 character name.

   KEYWORDS=keywords
      Specifies any keywords to be passed to the command. Up to 15 characters
      can be specified and must be enclosed by single quotes.

   AUTH=NO/YES
      Specifies whether MXI must be running authorised for this command to be
      available on the command menu.

   COMMENT='comment'
      Specifies any comment that is used to describe the command to the user.
      Up to 32 characters can be specified and must be enclosed by single
      quotes.

Examples
--------

(1) Add a menu choice to perform the SGRP command against the SPILL storage
    group.


     MXIMENU SET,                                                      x
               COMMAND=SGRP,                                           x
               KEYWORDS='SPILL',                                       x
               GROUP=SMS,                                              x
               COMMENT='Spill Storage Group'

(2) Add a menu choice to show the all address spaces that end 'CICS'. Assign
    this command to the 'CICS' command group.


     MXIMENU SET,                                                      x
               COMMAND=DA,                                             x
               KEYWORDS='*CICS',                                       x
               GROUP=CICS,                                             x
               COMMENT='CICS Regions'

Defining the end of the command menu
------------------------------------

The last non-comment statement in the command menu member must be
in the following format :

   MXIMENU END,SUFFIX=xx

This statement is used to denote the end of the MXIMENxx member and
calculate the number of choices defined. The suffix value MUST match the
one used on the MXIMENU START statement.

Considerations
--------------

(1) If you continue an MXIMENU statement over more than one line, you
    must place a continuation character in column 72 and start the next
    line in column 16.


Making The Command Menu Available To MXI
========================================

Before MXI can use the command menu, it must be assembled and linked
and then placed into a dataset that MXI can use a LOAD macro to access.

Assembling and linking
----------------------
Use the sample JCL in member $ASMMENU to assemble and link the command
menu source. Note that you must include the dataset that contains the
MXIMENU macro in the SYSLIB for the assemble.

Using the MXIMENxx member
-------------------------
Once linked, the MXIMENxx member can be made available to MXI in one
of two ways :

(1) STEPLIB/JOBLIB/LINKLIST
    The MXIMENxx member is loaded into private area storage by the
    execution of the LOAD macro. Note that placing MXIMENxx into a
    LIBDEFed ISPLLIB will NOT work.

(2) MXIXPT DDName
    If the MXIXPT DDName is found allocated to the current address
    space, it is searched BEFORE the normal STEPLIB/JOBLIB/LINKLIST
    search sequence to find the MXIMENxx member. This enables users
    that are invoking MXI using LIBDEFs to test and use MXIMENxx
    members.

    An example REXX EXEC to invoke MXI could be as follows :

    /* REXX */
    address ISPEXEC "LIBDEF ISPLLIB DATASET ID('MXI.LOAD') STACK"
    address ISPEXEC "LIBDEF ISPPLIB DATASET ID('MXI.PANELS') STACK"
    address ISPEXEC "LIBDEF ISPTLIB DATASET ID('MXI.TABLES') STACK"
    address TSO "ALLOC F(MXIXPT) DA('MXI.LOAD') SHR REUSE"
    address ISPEXEC "SELECT PGM(MXI) NEWAPPL(MXI) PASSLIB"
    address TSO "FREE F(MXIXPT)"
    address ISPEXEC "LIBDEF ISPTLIB"
    address ISPEXEC "LIBDEF ISPPLIB"
    address ISPEXEC "LIBDEF ISPLLIB"
    exit
