)AREA MXIHAREA
!Function
+  Displays the known remote systems that are defined to the MXI server and
+  allows the user to direct subsequent MXI commands to them.
+
+  This list also includes the special value 'HOME' which points to the local
+  system.
+
+  The system name can be chosen from the displayed list by point and shoot
+  action and is then stored as the default MXI system. The current remote
+  system name is shown on the MXI panel title line on the right hind side of
+  the local system name.
+
+  This can be changed at ANY point during a MXI session by re-issuing
+  the RSYS command. The RSYS HOME command should always return the current
+  MXI session to the local system.
+
+  When the remote system name is different from the local system, the CPU
+  UIC and PAG values shown on the panel title are for the remote system.
+
!Command Syntax
+ @RSYS sysmask
+
!Keywords      +
  @sysmask     +An optional masking pattern that can be used to filter the
               +displayed list on all or part of the system name.
               +The default value is '*'.
               +The wildcard character of '*' and a placeholder character of '%'
               +can be used.
+
!Examples
+ @RSYS S*                     +List all remote systems that start 'S'.
+ @RSYS IPO1                   +Set the remote system to IPO1. All subsequent
                               +MXI commands will be directed to the IPO1
                               +system.
+ @RSYS HOME                   +Reset to the local system.
