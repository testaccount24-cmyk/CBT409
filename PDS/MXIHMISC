)AREA MXIHAREA
!General Usage Tips
+ (1)+Most MXI commands can be entered on any MXI panel.
+ (2)+The previous screen output is saved and re-displayed on exit from the
+    +current screen.
+ (3)+Some fields are 'point-and-shoot'. Place the cursor anywhere within a
+     value that is defined as 'point-and-shoot' and press enter. MXI will then
+     take you to the most appropriate display.
+
!MXI Panel Title Line
+ The panel title line contains some important MXI and system information.
+
+ Example :
+
+¢MXI - DA --- SYS1 - IPO1 ----- CPU  23 UIC  254 PAG   30 -----Row 1 of 65
+       ¦      ¦      ¦          ¦       ¦        ¦
+       ¦      ¦      ¦          ¦       ¦        ¦
+    Command   ¦      ¦        System    ¦      System
+              ¦      ¦        CPU% Busy ¦      Total Paging
+            Local    ¦        (SRM)     ¦      Rate
+            System   ¦                  ¦
+                     ¦                System
+                   Remote             High UIC
+                   System
+                   (See RSYS Command)
+
+
!Running an initial command on ISPF invocation
+  To specify an initial command, you must invoke MXI using the SELECT PGM()
+  method and pass the name of the command you wish to execute via the PARM()
+  keyword. For example :
+
+      @SELECT PGM(MXI) PARM(IPL) NEWAPPL(MXI)
+
!Implementing the MXI Personal Dataset Application
+  You can use the MXI@DS+command to provide a fastpath ISPF application to
+  manipulate datasets. When MXI is invoked under ISPF with the initial command
+  of 'DS', MXI will bypass the primary menu display on exit. To take advantage
+  of the facility, code the following statements in your desired ISPF panel.
+
+  o  In the )BODY section :
+
+    ¢E   MXI/DS  MXI Personal Dataset List
+
+  o  In the )PROC section within the ZSEL logic :
+
+    ¢E,'PGM(MXI) PARM(DS) NEWAPPL(MXI) PASSLIB'
+
!Running MXI Authorized
+  To run MXI in authorized mode, ensure that :
+ @(a)+The load module¢MXITSF+is in an APF authorized library.
+ @(b)+The load module¢MXITSF+is available to the TSO user via STEPLIB,
+     +the system linklist or LPA list.
+ @(c)+The@AUTHTSF+section of@IKJTSOxx+has an entry for¢MXITSF
+
!Running MXI in Batch
+The JCL required to invoke MXI in batch is as follows :
+
+ @//BATCH    EXEC PGM=MXI,PARM='BATCH'
+ @//SYSPRINT DD   SYSOUT=*
+ @//SYSIN    DD   *
+  mxi-commands
+ @/*
+
+ The batch invocation accepts most MXI commands as input via the SYSIN DDname.
+ You can specify from 1 to 999 commands as individual card images within the
+ SYSIN input. The output is written to the SYSPRINT DDname, which, if not being
+ directed to spool has the following DCB attributes : RECFM=FBA, LRECL=133,
+ BLKSIZE=13300
+
+ The maximum individual command length is 71 bytes.
+
+ You can also specify an extra parameter of 'NOTITLES' to the MXI batch program
+ which will suppress the production of titles and page-breaks.
+
+
!Batch Example 1
+ @//BATCH    EXEC PGM=MXI,PARM='BATCH'
+ @//SYSPRINT DD   SYSOUT=*
+ @//SYSIN    DD   *
+  SET DSCB ON
+  LINK
+  LPA
+  SET DSCB OFF
+  APF
+ @/*
+
!Batch Example 2
+ @//BATCH    EXEC PGM=MXI,PARM='BATCH,NOTITLES'
+ @//SYSPRINT DD   SYSOUT=*
+ @//SYSIN    DD   *
+  NUC
+  LPD
+  SMSM
+ @/*
+
!Using the MXI REXX Interface
+MXI also has a REXX function interface. One or more MXI commands can
+be passsed to the REXX function and the result of the commands are
+placed sequentially in the specified REXX stem.
+
!Syntax
+   ¢rcode = MXIREXX(stemname,cmd1,cmd2,....,cmdn)
+
!Keywords
+   ¢RCODE   +Return code from the MXIREXX function
+
+   ¢STEMNAME+The name of the stem variable to hold the result of the
+             commands. This must be enclosed in quotes. The maximum
+             length of the stem name is 24 characters including the
+             fullstop at the end of the name.
+
+   ¢CMDn    +The MXI command(s) executed. These must be enclosed in
+             quotes and separated by commas.
+             The maximum support length of a single command is 72
+             bytes.
+
+             NOTE : If you wish to suppress the titles and columns you
+                    can specify a special value of 'NOTITLES' as the
+                    first command passed to MXIREXX.
+
+
+!REXX API Example
+
+  rcode = MXIREXX('line.','SET DSCB ON','LPA',LINK SYS1.*')
+  do i = 1 to line.0
+    say line.i
+    end
+  exit
+
