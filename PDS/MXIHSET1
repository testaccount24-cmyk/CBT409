)AREA MXIHAREA
!Function
+  Controls MXI screen attributes for specific panel elements.
+
!Force tab to point and shoot fields
+  When selected, this causes MXI to set on the ISPF 'Tab to point and shoot'
+  setting. When MXI is terminated, it will reset this ISPF setting to its
+  previous value. This setting only applies to users who have NOT set the
+  'Tab to point and shoot fields' in their ISPF settings.
+  Note that changes to this setting take effect on the next invocation
+  of MXI.
+
!Use EDIT for point and shoot dataset name
+  When selected, this causes MXI to use ISPF EDIT when a point and shoot action
+  is taken for a dataset name. If this option is not selected, MXI will use
+  ISPF VIEW instead.
+

+  following values :
+  ¢RED
