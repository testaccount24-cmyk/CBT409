//***FILE 409 contains the card image members associated with the   *   FILE 409
//*           MXI package from Rob Scott, of Rocket Software.       *   FILE 409
//*           The MXI package is a type of system monitor that      *   FILE 409
//*           can run under ISPF, in batch, or it can be invoked    *   FILE 409
//*           under REXX.  MXI is an extremely powerful program     *   FILE 409
//*           that can tell you very much about your MVS operating  *   FILE 409
//*           system, how it is set up, and what is running on      *   FILE 409
//*           it.  Load modules (sorry, no source) are on File      *   FILE 409
