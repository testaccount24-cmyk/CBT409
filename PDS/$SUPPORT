Trouble-Shooting Guide for MXI
------------------------------

If MXI is either abending or producing unexpected results, the following
few simple steps could help resolve the problem.

o Ensure that the MXI load library is in a single extent. MXI has two
  VERY large load modules and I have seen strange 0C4 abends occur when
  the load library is in multiple extents.

o Verify that you do not have earlier releases of MXI modules ahead of
  the intended new MXI modules. This is especially critical for
  authorised commands and those that can have authorised and
  non-authorised versions (eg the "DA" command).

o If the problem occurs online, try running it in batch mode.
  If this also fails, it is a good chance that there is a problem in
  the MXI code.

o As supplied, MXI will wait for a maximum of 5 seconds to get a
  response from the operator command and once a response is received it
  will wait a further second for the message buffer to be filled.

  If you want to change these limits, please see the $MXIOPTN member of
  this dataset.

o If MXI abends, please send me the SYSUDUMP output (in EBCDIC binary
  if possible) and I will attempt to fix the problem as soon as I can.

o When reporting problems, it helps a lot if you mention the release
  of MVS, JES and DFSMS and if you are running RACF and RMF.

o MXI sometimes uses undocumented/unsupported methods to get some of
  its information. It is possible that the source of this information
  is liable to change by IBM without warning (the most common
  consequence of this is an 0C4 abend). I try to keep this sort of
  code to a minimum, but sometimes IBM leave me with no choice....
