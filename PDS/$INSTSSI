THE MXI SUBSYSTEM
=================

MXI can make use of a subsystem entry and some anchored common storage  o
to provide the following.

(1) LPAR information on the CPU command display for more recent releases
    of OS/390 and z/OS.
(2) LLA module fetch statistics.
(3) LOGGER information.

Installing The MXI Subsystem
============================

The MXI subsystem "MXI" is installed dynamically by the general purpose
MXISERV utility. The subsystem can also be subsequently deactivated and
re-activated by running the MXISERV program with a certain set of
control card statements.

(1) Adding the MXI Subsystem
    Run the MXISERV utility using the SUBSYS=YES control card

    Example :

    //ADDSUB  EXEC PGM=MXISERV
    //STEPLIB   DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS2.MXI.LOAD
    //SYSIN     DD *
      SUBSYS=ADD
    /*

    Execution of the above will perform the following actions :

    (o)   Add the "MXI" subsystem to MVS
    (o)   Acquire some E-CSA storage to hold the MXCT and MXLS control
          blocks (all E-CSA acquired by MXISERV is in Key 4).
    (o)   Place the address of the MXCT in the SSCTSUSE field of the
          MXI subsystem SSCT.

    Using just the SUBSYS=ADD control card on its own does not enable
    features or data collection. The MXCT and associated control
    blocks are only used if other control cards are specified to the
    MXISERV program - these will be explained in detail later.

(2) Deleting the MXI Subsystem
    Run the MXISERV utility using the SUBSYS=DELETE control card

    Example :

    //DELSUB  EXEC PGM=MXISERV
    //STEPLIB   DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS2.MXI.LOAD
    //SYSIN     DD *
      SUBSYS=DELETE
    /*

    Execution of the above will perform the following actions :

    (o)   Set flags in the MXCT control block to warn the data
          collection routines that the subsystem is coming down.
    (o)   Wait for 10 seconds.
    (o)   Delete the MXIU83 SMF exit (if installed)
    (o)   Free the MXCT and MXLS control blocks
    (o)   Zero the SSCTSUSE field in the MXI subsystem SSCT.

    The MXI subsystem entry is NOT removed from the SSCT chain, but
    for all intents and purposes it is dormant.

    The SUBSYS=DELETE function can be safely used at any time, but
    bear in mind that all data collected in E-CSA will be lost.

(3) Collecting LPAR Information When RMF Installed
    To implement the collection of LPAR information for more recent
    releases of OS/390 and z/OS, MXISERV dynamically installs an
    IEFU83 exit (called 'MXIU83') into the SYSSTC.IEFU83 exit
    sequence. MXI gathers LPAR information by copying SMF
    type 70 records to an area of E-CSA pointed to by the MXCT
    control block. When the CPU command is issued by MXI users and
    the SMF record type 70 can be found from the MXCT, the LPAR
    information can be derived from here rather than from OCO
    RMF control blocks (as in previous releases of MXI).

    However the are some SMF prereqs :

    (1) SMF subsystem 'STC' must be defined
    (2) IEFU83 exit is defined as active for 'STC'
    (3) Type 70 SMF records are being recorded for the 'STC'
        subsystem.

    Extract from sample SMFPRMxx :

    SUBSYS(STC,TYPE(30,70:79,88,100,101,102,118(5)),
      EXITS(IEFU29,IEFACTRT,IEFU83))

    To actiavte this facility, use the IEFU83=YES control card along
    with the SUBSYS=ADD control card. Note that the MXISERV default
    is IEFU83=NO.

    The MXIU83 exit is installed from the SYSLIB DDname if specified
    in the JCL, otherwise the linklist and LPA are searched to locate
    the module.

    Example :

    //ADDSUB  EXEC PGM=MXISERV
    //STEPLIB   DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS2.MXI.LOAD
    //SYSLIB    DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS2.MXI.LOAD
    //SYSIN     DD *
      SUBSYS=ADD
      IEFU83=YES
    /*

    Execution of the above will perform the following actions :

    (o)   Add the "MXI" subsystem to MVS
    (o)   Acquire some E-CSA storage to hold the MXCT and MXLS control
          blocks
    (o)   Place the address of the MXCT in the SSCTSUSE field of the
          MXI subsystem SSCT.
    (o)   Add MXIU83 to the SYSSTC.IEFU83 exit copying the load module
          from the SYSLIB dataset.

    The code in MXIU83 currently performs the following :

    (o)   Test existance of MXI subsystem.
    (o)   Test existance of MXCT.
    (o)   Test flag settings in MXCT.
    (o)   Move the SMF type 70 record into the E-CSA storage area
          pointed to by the MXCT.

(4) Collecting LPAR Information When CMF Installed
    To implement the collection of LPAR information for more recent
    releases of OS/390 and z/OS, MXISERV dynamically installs an
    IEFU84 exit (called 'MXIU84') into the SYSCMF.IEFU84 exit
    sequence. MXI gathers LPAR information by copying SMF
    type 70 records to an area of E-CSA pointed to by the MXCT
    control block. When the CPU command is issued by MXI users and
    the SMF record type 70 can be found from the MXCT, the LPAR
    information can be derived from here rather than from OCO
    RMF control blocks (as in previous releases of MXI).

    However the are some SMF prereqs :

    (1) SMF subsystem 'CMF' must be defined
    (2) IEFU84 exit is defined as active for 'CMF'
    (3) Type 70 SMF records are being recorded for the 'CMF'
        subsystem.

    Extract from sample SMFPRMxx :

    SUBSYS(CMF,TYPE(70:79),
      EXITS(IEFU84))

    To actiavte this facility, use the IEFU84=YES control card along
    with the SUBSYS=ADD control card. Note that the MXISERV default
    is IEFU84=NO.

    The MXIU84 exit is installed from the SYSLIB DDname if specified
    in the JCL, otherwise the linklist and LPA are searched to locate
    the module.

    Example :

    //ADDSUB  EXEC PGM=MXISERV
    //STEPLIB   DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS2.MXI.LOAD
    //SYSLIB    DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS2.MXI.LOAD
    //SYSIN     DD *
      SUBSYS=ADD
      IEFU84=YES
    /*

    Execution of the above will perform the following actions :

    (o)   Add the "MXI" subsystem to MVS
    (o)   Acquire some E-CSA storage to hold the MXCT and MXLS control
          blocks
    (o)   Place the address of the MXCT in the SSCTSUSE field of the
          MXI subsystem SSCT.
    (o)   Add MXIU84 to the SYSCMF.IEFU84 exit copying the load module
          from the SYSLIB dataset.

    The code in MXIU84 currently performs the following :

    (o)   Test existance of MXI subsystem.
    (o)   Test existance of MXCT.
    (o)   Test flag settings in MXCT.
    (o)   Move the SMF type 70 record into the E-CSA storage area
          pointed to by the MXCT.

    *IMPORTANT*---------------------------------------------*IMPORTANT*

    I have observed that in certain releases or configurations of CMF
    the type 70 records are written to the "STC" SMF subsystem instead
    of the "CMF" subsystem.
    To cater for this instance, you can override the default SMF
    subsystem used by MXIU84 by coding the MXISERV control card :

       IEFU84SMFSUB=xxxx    where 'xxxx' is the SMF subsystem

    So, if you find that the CPU command does not produce LPAR
    information as expected, run MXISERV with SUBSYS=DELETE and
    then restart MXISERV with both :

       IEFU84=YES
       IEFU84SMFSUB=STC

    *IMPORTANT*---------------------------------------------*IMPORTANT*

(5) Collecting Log Stream Information
    To implement the collection of log stream information and statistics
    MXISERV dynamically installs an IEFU83 exit (called 'MXIU83') into
    the SYSSTC.IEFU83 exit sequence.
    MXI gathers log stream information by copying SMF 88-1 records into
    an area of E-CSA pointed to by the MXCTMX88 field in the MXCT
    control block.
    Note that this method is common between sites that use RMF or CMF.
    The MXIU84 exit will NOT be invoked for type 88-1 records and
    MXIU83 must be used.

    However there are some SMF prereqs :

    (1) SMF subsystem 'STC' must be defined
    (2) IEFU83 exit is defined as active for 'STC'
    (3) Type 88 SMF records are being recorded for the 'STC'
        subsystem.

    Extract from sample SMFPRMxx :

    SUBSYS(STC,TYPE(30,70:79,88,100,101,102,118(5)),
      EXITS(IEFU29,IEFACTRT,IEFU83))

    To actiavte this facility, use the IEFU83=YES control card along
    with the SUBSYS=ADD control card. Note that the MXISERV default
    is IEFU83=NO.

    The MXIU83 exit is installed from the SYSLIB DDname if specified
    in the JCL, otherwise the linklist and LPA are searched to locate
    the module.

    Example :

    //ADDSUB  EXEC PGM=MXISERV
    //STEPLIB   DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS2.MXI.LOAD
    //SYSLIB    DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS2.MXI.LOAD
    //SYSIN     DD *
      SUBSYS=ADD
      IEFU83=YES
    /*

    Execution of the above will perform the following actions :

    (o)   Add the "MXI" subsystem to MVS
    (o)   Acquire some E-CSA storage to hold the MXCT and MXLS control
          blocks
    (o)   Place the address of the MXCT in the SSCTSUSE field of the
          MXI subsystem SSCT.
    (o)   Add MXIU83 to the SYSSTC.IEFU83 exit copying the load module
          from the SYSLIB dataset.

    The code in MXIU83 currently performs the following :

    (o)   Test existance of MXI subsystem.
    (o)   Test existance of MXCT.
    (o)   Test flag settings in MXCT.
    (o)   Move the SMF type 88-1 record into the E-CSA storage area
          pointed to by the MXCTMX88 field of the MXCT.

(6) Collecting LLA module fetch statistics
    To implement the collection of LLA module fetch statistics, the
    supplied CSVLLIX1 exit must in installed into the MVS linklist.
    During initialization, the LLA address space will notice the
    presence of the load module and activate the exit. Activation of
    this exit can also be performed by issuing MODIFY commands to
    LLA.

    The MXI-supplied exit can also cut an optional user SMF record to
    allow you to gather historical data during SMF record processing.
    See the LLASMF parameter on the MXI global options ($INSTOPT).
    The SMF record produced is mapped by the MXSMFREC macro.

    If you do not already have a CSVLLIX1 exit installed on your system
    then run the $ASMCSV job and either IPL or issue LLA modify commands
    to activate the exit.

    If you have an existing CSVLLIX1 exit, you can easily adapt the
    supplied CSVLLIX1 source to call the MXI module MXILLIX1 before the
    your own code. On exit on MXILLIX1, the contents of R1 are restored
    to point to the LLP1 paramter list. Remember to linkedit the
    supplied MXILLIX1 load module into your site CSVLLIX1 exit.

    Do not invoke MXILLIX1 from CSVLLIX1 using any method that would
    cause program fetch to occur (eg LINK macro).

    The MXI subsystem must be installed for LLA fetch statistics to
    be gathered.

    To dynamically activate the LLA module fetch stats, you can perform
    the following actions :

    (o)   Install CSVLLIX1 into the MVS linklist
    (o)   Ensure that the MXI subsystem has been installed
    (o)   Create a CSVLLA## member of PARMLIB that specifies "EXIT1(ON)"
    (o)   Issue command F LLA,UPDATE=##

    The code in MXILLIX1 currently performs the following :

    (o)   Test existance of MXI subsystem.
    (o)   Test existance of MXCT.
    (o)   Test flag settings in MXCT.
    (o)   Cut SMF record if required (see LLASMF global option).
    (o)   Test existance of MXLS.
    (o)   Serialiize access to MXLS using CS.
    (o)   Update MXLS with data from LLP1

Notes
(1) I recommend that the MXI subsystem is installed as early as possible
    during the IPL process in order to collect the maximum amount of
    data. This can be achieved by placing the "S MXISERV" command in
    the COMMNDxx member of PARMLIB and placing the supplied MXISERV
    started task JCL in your system PROCLIB.

(2) The MXISERV started task will only stay active if the MXI TCP/IP
    server has been requested. Otherwise the started task will terminate
    after the MXI subsystem has been installed. See member $INSTTCP for
    more information on the MXI TCP/IP server.

(3) In order for MXISERV to install the MXI subsystem, it must be
    invoked from an APF authorized library.

(4) LLA statistics are only available from the time that the CSVLLIX1
    exit has been activated.
