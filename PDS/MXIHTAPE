)AREA MXIHAREA
!Function
+  Displays the current online TAPE units.
+
!Command Syntax
+ @TAPE unit-mask+
+
!Keywords      +
  @unit-mask   +An optional masking pattern that can be used to filter the
               +displayed list on all or part of the unit address.
               +The wildcard character of '*' and a placeholder character of '%'
               +can be used. The default value of unit-mask is '*'.
+
!Example
+ @TAPE 34*   + List all TAPE units in the range 0340-034F
+ @TAPE 590   + List TAPE unit 590
+
!Considerations
+ If the resultant list from the TAPE command contains only a single entry,
+ a more detailed panel is displayed.
+
!Output Panel Fields (Multiple Tape Units)
  @Unit            +- Device unit address
  @Status          +- Status of the device
  @Type            +- Device type of the unit
  @Volser          +- Volume serial number mounted on the unit
  @Label           +- Label Number being processed
  @LTyp            +- Type of label being used
  @Jobname         +- Name of job using the device
  @EXCP            +- Number of I/Os performed to this device. Note that for
                   +  24-bit UCBs this value is taken from the UCBSIO field
                   +  which is a halfword and will wrap every 65K I/Os. For
                   +  31-bit UCBs, the value is taken from UCBCX-SIO which
                   +  is a fullword.
  @BLP             +- Bypass Label Processing status
  @IDRC            +- Hardware Compression status
+
!Output Panel Fields (Single Tape Unit)
+The display is split into five sections
