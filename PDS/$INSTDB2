MXI DB2 Commands
================

MXI can get information from the active DB2 subsystems using IFI calls. o

Associated members in this dataset :

o $INSTDB2  - This member
o $INSTOPT  - Default options (see DB= and DB2MON1=)


Setup Requirements
==================

The following MXI commands use DB2 IFI calls to retrieve DB2 trace data
so that it can be formatted for the user:

    DBBP   -  DB2 Buffer Pools
    DBDA   -  DB2 Threads
    DBEP   -  DB2 EDM Pool Statistics
    DBGP   -  DB2 Get Page Requests
    DBLK   -  DB2 Locking Statistics
    DBZP   -  DB2 System Parameters

In order for the information to be gathered by MXI, the following must
be true :

(1) The executing userid must have DB2 MONITOR1 and MONITOR2 privileges.
(2) The DB2 MONITOR1 trace must be active.
(3) The DB2 SDSNLOAD libray must be either in the linklist or in the
    STEPLIB.

If the DB2 MONITOR1 trace is not active, MXI can automatically start it
depending on the DB2MON1 global setting. Although the overhead for
running the MONITOR1 trace is quite low, you can prevent MXI from
starting it by coding DB2MON1=NO in the MXI global options.
