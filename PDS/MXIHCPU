)AREA MXIHAREA
!Function
+  Displays information concerning the CPU configuration.
+
!Command Syntax
+ @CPU+
+
!Considerations
+  Without the MXI subsystem installed, the CPU command will not show LPAR
+  information if one or more of the following is true :
+
+  o System running under VM
+  o RMF is not active
+  o Processor not in PR/SM mode
+  o Operating system is OS/390 R10 or above
+
+ When the MXI subsystem is installed and the MXIU83 exit is active,  MXI can
+ gather LPAR information from SMF Type 70 records.
+
!Output Panel Fields
+  The display is split into three main sections
+
!Processor Information
+ @CPU Model        +- The model number of the processor
+ @CPU Type Code    +- The model type of the processor
+ @Physical CPUs    +- The number of physical CPUs on the processor including
+                   +  those offline to this MVS image.
+ @Total MIPS       +- Estimated total MIPS.
+ @SU/Second        +- Service Units per second.
+ @MIPS/CPU         +- Estimated MIPS per CPU.
+ @CPU Adjustment   +- Value taken from RMCTADJC.
+ @MSU              +- Used for PSLC (not applicable for Amdahl machines).
+ @Serial Numbers   +- CPU serial numbers.
+
!Main Storage Information
+ @Real Online      +- The amount of real storage online (in Mb)

+  The following five fields are NOT shown when the system is running in ESAME
   (ARCHLVL=2) mode.

+ @Real Offline     +- The amount of real storage offline (in Mb)
+ @Real AFC         +- The number of real storage frames on the Available Frame
                    +  Queue
+ @Expanded Online  +- The amount of expanded storage online (in Mb)
+ @Expanded Offline +- The amount of expanded storage offline (in Mb)
+ @Expanded AFC     +- The number of expanded storage frames on the Available
                    +  Frame Queue.
+
!Logical Partition Information
+ @Configured LPARs +- The number of logical partitions defined

+ @LPAR Name        +- The name of the logical partition.
+ @LPAR Number      +- The number of the logical partition.
+ @Logical CPUs     +- The number of the logical CPUs available to this logical
+                   +  partition.
+ @Dedicated CPUs   +- The number of the CPUs that are dedicated to this
+                   +  logical partition.
+ @Relative Share   +- The relative share of CPU resources available to the
+                   +  logical partition.
+ @Cap              +- If the logical partition is capped (Yes/No)
+ @WTC              +- If the wait completion has be turned on in the logical
+ @                 +  partition definition (Yes/No)
