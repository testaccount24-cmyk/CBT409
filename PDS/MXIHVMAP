!Output Panel Fields
  @Area            +- The area of storage described
  @Start           +- The low address of the storage area
  @End             +- The high address of the storage area
  @Size(K)         +- The length of the storage area in 'K'
                   +  Note that is normally the difference between the
                   +  upper and lower address boundaries. However when
                   +  SQA overflows into CSA the corresponding CSA size
                   +  is reduced by the overflow amount.
  @%Use            +- Percentage currently used (CSA and SQA only)
                   +  Note that when SQA overflows into CSA the size
                   +  of CSA used to calculate the percentage used is
                   +  reduced by the overflow amount.
  @Overflow        +- Amount of SQA that has overflowed into CSA
  @Size(Mb)        +- The length of the storage area in 'Mb'
+
+  The following three fields describe the storage allocation and use of the
+  home address space.
+
  @Region Requested+- Region size requested
  @Region Above 16M+- Extended private area allocated and used
  @Region Below 16M+- Private area allocated and used
+
+  The following three fields describe the current setting (via DIAGxx) of
+  various storage tracking options. They can be either 'Active' or 'Inactive'.
+
  @CSA Tracking+    - CSA and ECSA Storage Tracking
  @SQA Tracking+    - SQA and ESQA Storage Tracking
  @GFS Trace+       - GETMAIN and FREEMAIN Storage Trace
