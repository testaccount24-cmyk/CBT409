!Function
+  Change the swap status of a selected address space
+
!Command Syntax
+ $MAKE jobname SWAP(YES/NO)
+ $     A=asid  CPU(MAX/MIN)
+
!Keywords
+ $jobname   +A specific jobname of a single active address space whose
+            +swap status is to be changed.
+ $A=asid    +An alternative specification to jobname that uses the hexadecimal
+            +address space id (ASID) rather than the jobname. Note that all
+            +four hexadecimal digits MUST be specified and that wildcards
+            +cannot be used. Use this form when there is more than one instance
+            +of an address space with the same name.
+ $SWAP(NO)  +Make the specified address space non-swappable.
+ $SWAP(YES) +Make the specified address space swappable.
+ $CPU(MAX)  +Set the address space to have a maximum CPU limit. Use this
+            +to prevent an address space from abending with a 322 system code.
             +Address spaces whose jobstep program is marked as not being timed
             +in the PPT are NOT affected by this keyword.
+ $CPU(MIN)  +Set the address space to have a minimum CPU limit. Use this
+            +to force an address space to abend with a 322 system code.
             +Address spaces whose jobstep program is marked as not being timed
             +in the PPT are NOT affected by this keyword.
+
!Examples
+ $MAKE JOB0001 CPU(MAX) +Make job JOB0001 have a maximum CPU time limit.
+ $MAKE JOB0001 SWAP(NO) +Make job JOB0001 non-swappable
+ $MAKE A=002C SWAP(YES) +Make ASID 002C swappable
+
!Considerations
+ +Use this command with care.
+ +SEC recommends using the@A=asid+form to ensure that the correct
+ +task is affected.
