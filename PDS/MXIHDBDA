!Function
+  Displays DB2 thread information
+
!Command Syntax
+ @DBDA tokenmask ONLY(IN/OUT/ALL) DB(sub)
+
!Keywords      +
  @tokenmask   +An optional masking pattern that can be used to filter the
               +displayed list on all or part of the thread token.
               +The default value is '*'.
               +The wildcard character of '*' and a placeholder character of '%'
               +can be used.
  @ONLY(IN)    +An optional keyword that instructs the DBDA command to only
               +show active threads. This is the default
  @ONLY(OUT)   +An optional keyword that instructs the DBDA command to only
               +show inactive threads.
  @ONLY(ALL)   +An optional keyword that instructs the DBDA command to show
               +both active and inactive threads.
  @DB(sub)     +Direct the DBDA command to use the 'sub' DB2 subsystem.
+
!Examples
+ @DBDA 1234      +Show thread information for the thread whose token is '1234'.
+ @DBDA ONLY(ALL) +Show all threads.
+ @DBDA DB(DSN2)  +Show all threads from subsystem DSN2.
+
!Considerations
 +For the DBDA command to function correctly, the userid must have the MONITOR1
 +DB2 privilege.

                      after a COMMIT but DB2 no longer had a valid

  @Prepare Purge   +- The number of times that a prepared statement
                      was purged from the cache because a DROP, ALTER
