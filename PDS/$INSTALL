Instructions on how to install MXI from this dataset
----------------------------------------------------

Step 1.  Ensure that you have downloaded the MXI load library as well
         as this file.

Step 2.  Run the $INSTJCL JCL from this dataset to allocate and
         populate the required runtime datasets.

Step 3.  By now you should have *THREE* datasets :
         (o) The MXI load library with 13 members
         (o) The MXI panel dataset with 132 members
         (o) The MXI table dataset with 1 member

Step 4.  Place the MXI panels dataset in your ISPPLIB concatenation.

Step 5.  Place the MXI tables dataset in your ISPTLIB concatenation.

Step 6.  Make the MXI load library available.
         You can do this in one of two ways :

         (a)  Run MXI as authorised (Preferred)
              To take full advantage of all MXI functions, perform the
              following :
              o  Add the MXI load library to the MVS Linklist
              o  Add MXITSF to AUTHTSF section in IKJTSOxx

              NOTE **ENSURE THAT MXI MODULES ARE NOT IN YOUR ISPLLIB **
                   **CONCATANATION. YOU MAY NOT USE LIBDEFS FOR MXI  **
                   **MODULES IF YOU PLAN TO RUN AUTHORIZED           **

              NOTE **IF YOU PLAN TO RUN MXI AUTHORIZED PLEASE TEST   **
                   **IT THOUROUGHLY ON A NON-PRODUCTION SYSTEM FIRST.**
                   **ALTHOUGH MXI IS BETA-TESTED AT 6 DIFFERENT SITES**
                   **THERE IS NO WAY TO GUARANTEE THAT IT WILL RUN   **
                   **WITHOUT ERROR AT YOUR SITE.                     **

         (b)  Run MXI non-authorised
              o  Add the MXI load library to your ISPLLIB or STEPLIB
                 concatenation.

Step 7.  Add MXI as an ISPF panel choice.

         Edit your ISR@PRIM panel to include the following two lines :
         (a) In the )BODY section :

             M   MXI    MVS Extended Information

         (b) In the )PROC section within the ZSEL logic :

             M,'PGM(MXI) NEWAPPL(MXI) PASSLIB'

Step 8.  Customise the exception rules table (optional)

         See the $INSTXPT member in this dataset for further
         instructions.

Step 9.  Customise the global options (optional)

         See the $INSTOPT member in this dataset for further
         instructions.

Step 10. Protect commands commands (optional)

         This step only applies if you are running MXI in authorised
         mode.

         See the $INSTSEC member in this dataset for further
         instructions.

         ** IMPORTANT **
         MXI 4.3 now provides the ability the protect non-authorised
         commands. Please review your RACF profiles or MXISECTB source.

         If you previously coded NOENTRY=DENY (internal) or UACC=NONE
         on MXICMD.* (external), you will need to adjust the rules to
         cater for all non-auth commands.
         ** IMPORTANT **

Step 11. Implement the MXI subsystem (optional)

         This step only applies if one of the following is true :
         (a) You wish to use the LLA command to view LLA fetch
             statistics
         (b) You wish to view LPAR information on the CPU command
             display and your version of OS/390 is R9 or higher.
         (c) You wish to view LOGGER information via the LOGR command.

         See the $INSTSSI member in this dataset for further
         instructions.

Step 12. Implement the MXI TCP/IP Server (optional)

         This step applies if you wish to direct MXI comamnds
         to remote systems and receive the displays on your local
         system.

         Implementing the MXI TCP/IP server is recommended and does
         not require APF authorisation.

         See the $INSTTCP member in this dataset for further
         instructions.

Step 13. Consider MXI DB2 requirements (optional)

         This step applies if you wish to use the MXI DB2 commands.

         See the $INSTDB2 member in this dataset for further
         instructions.

Step 14. Implementing the MXI Personal Dataset Application (optional)

         Edit your ISR@PRIM panel to include the following two lines :
         (a) In the )BODY section :
             E   MXI/DS  MXI Personal Dataset List

         (b) In the )PROC section within the ZSEL logic :
             E,'PGM(MXI) PARM(DS) NEWAPPL(MXI) PASSLIB'

         Note : Issue the SET DS command to specify your personal datasets

Step 15. Customise the MXI Command Menu (optional)

         See the $INSTMEN member in this dataset for further
         instructions.

Step 16. The installation is now complete.

Notes
(1)      The splitting of the INSTLIB dataset into a PANELS and a TABLES
         dataset is optional. You could opt to just allocate the INSTLIB
         dataset to ISPPLIB and also ISPTLIB. This could speed up the
         installation process - but I recommends that separate
         datasets are used because the INSTLIB dataset contains members
         that are not prefixed 'MXI' and could clash against other
         software.
