)AREA MXIHAREA
!Function
+  Displays the current active log streams.
+
!Command Syntax
+ @LOGR log-mask
+
!Keywords      +
  @log-mask    +An optional masking pattern that can be used to filter the
               +displayed list on all or part of the log stream name.
               +The wildcard character of '*' and a placeholder character of '%'
               +can be used. The default value is '*'.
+
!Example
+ @LOGR ATR* +  List all log streams starting 'ATR'.
+
!Considerations
  +The@LOGR+command requires the MXIU83 exit to be installed and active.
  +It also requires the MXI subsystem. MXI collects log stream information from
  +SMF-88 records collected by the MXIU83 exit which are placed into a common
  +storage area pointed to by the MXI subsystem.
+
+ +After initial installation of the MXIU83 exit, the LOGR command will only be
+ +able to show logger information after the next SMF interval.
+
!Output Panel Fields
  @Stream          +- Name of the log stream.
  @Struct          +- Name of the structure or '*DASDONLY* for DASD-only log
                   +  streams.
  @T1-Comp         +- Number of Type-1 completions.
  @T2-Comp         +- Number of Type-2 completions.
  @T3-Comp         +- Number of Type-3 completions.
+
+When only one log stream matches the specified pattern mask, a more detailed
+list is displayed.

!Log Stream
  @Log Stream Name +- The name of the log stream.
  @Statistics Date +- The date that the statistics were gathered (yyyy/mm/dd).
  @           Time +- The time that the statistics were gathered.
  @Minimum BLOCKLEN+- The minimum blocklen value of IXGWRITE seen during the
                   +  expiring SMF interval.
  @Maximum BLOCKLEN+- The maximum blocklen value of IXGWRITE seen during the
                   +  expiring SMF interval.
  @Stage Datasets  +- The log stream is using staging datasets.
  @Disconnected    +- The log stream is disconnected from the system.
  @No of IXGWRITES +- The number of IXGWRITE invocations seen during the
                   +  expiring SMF interval.
  @Appl Bytes Req  +- The number of bytes requested by user applications
                   +  on IXGWRITE invocations during the expiring SMF
                   +  interval.
  @Bytes to DASD   +- Count of bytes written ro DASD during the expiring
                   +  SMF interval.

!Structure
  @Structure Name  +- The associated structure name or '*DASDONLY*' for
                   +  DASD-only log streams
  @Current Written +- Count of bytes written to interim storage during the
                   +  expiring SMF interval.
  @Current Instead +- Count of bytes deleted from interim storage instead of
                   +  being written to DASD during the expiring SMF interval.
  @Current After   +- Count of bytes deleted from interim storage after being
                   +  written to DASD during the expiring SMF interval.
  @Instead Invoke  +- Count of times a deletion from interim storage was
                   +  performed during the expiring SMF interval where the data
                   +  was not first migrated to DASD.
  @Instead Invoke  +- Count of times a deletion from interim storage was
                   +  performed during the expiring SMF interval after the data
                   +  was migrated to DASD.
  @Type-1 Complete +- Count of type-1 completions. Log stream contents can
                   +  remain in interim storage. No need to move data from
                   +  interim storage to DASD.
  @Type-2 Complete +- Count of type-2 completions. Log stream is filling
                   +  interim storage but is not critical. Logger must
                   +  move data from interim storage to DASD.
  @Type-3 Complete +- Count of type-3 completions. Space used in interim
                   +  storage by this log stream is critical.

!Events
  @Structure Full  +- Count of the number of times IXGWRITE detected a
                   +  'structure full' condition during the expiring SMF
                   +  interval.
  @Str Rebuild Sta +- Number of 'structure rebuild' events initiated
                   +  during the expiring SMF interval.
  @DASD Shifts     +- Number of log stream DASD-shifts initiated during
                   +  the expiring SMF interval.
  @Str Rebuild End +- Number of 'structure rebuild' events completed
                   +  during the expiring SMF interval.
  @Stage DSN Thresh+- Count of the number of times IXGWRITE detected a
                   +  'staging dataset threshold hit' condition during
                   +  the expiring SMF interval.
  @Offload OK      +- Number of successful offloads performed.
  @Stage DSN Full  +- Count of the number of times IXGWRITE detected a
                   +  'staging dataset full' condition during the expiring
                   +  SMF interval.
  @Offload 90%     +- Number of times offload was initiated due to the
                   +  total in-use list entries reaching 90% during the
                   +  expiring SMF interval.
  @Offload Requests+- Number of times a demand initiated offload was
                   +  requested (via IXGOFFLD) during the expiring SMF
                   +  interval.
