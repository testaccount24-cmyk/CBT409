!Function
+  Displays the ASIDs that have been marked non-reusable by the system and to
+  which address spaces these ASIDs had latent cross memory links.
+
!Command Syntax
+ @MDQ+
+
!Output Panel Fields
  @Jobname         +- Jobname of the non-reusable address space.
  @ASID            +- Hexadecimal ASID.
  @To              +- Number of cross memory connections TO another ASID at
                   +  address space termination. A special value of '*' is used
                   +  to denote connections to ALL address spaces.
  @From            +- Number of cross memory connections FROM another ASID at
                   +  address space termination. A special value of '*' is used
                   +  to denote connections to ALL address spaces.
  @XMSE            +- Address of the XMSE in the PCAUTH private area.
  @ASCB            +- ASCB of the terminated task. Note that certain fields in
                   +  this ASCB have been 'scrambled' by MVS to ensure system
                   +  integrity.
  @Type            +- Direction of the cross memory connection
  @CJOB            +- Jobname of connected address space.
  @CAID            +- Hexadecimal ASID of connected address space.
  @Status          +- The status of the connected address space :
                   +     ¢Active    + The address space is still active
                   +     ¢Inactive  + The address space has terminated
                   +     ¢System LX + This is a system LX connection
