)AREA MXIHAREA
!Function
+  Displays the current TCB tree and RB chains.
+
!Command Syntax
+ @TCB JOB(jobname)
+     @ASID(asid)
+
!Keywords
  @JOB(jobname)+An optional keyword that specifies the address space name whose
               +TCB structure is to be examined. Wildcards are not allowed.
  @ASID(asid)  +An optional keyword that specifies the hexadecimal ASID whose
               +TCB structure is to be examined. All four bytes of the
               +ASID keyword MUST be completed. Wildcards are not allowed.

               +Note that the JOB() and ASID() keywords require MXI to be
               +running authorized. For further information on running MXI in
               +authorized mode, please see the@MISC+section of this HELP dialog
+
!Examples
  @TCB              +  Show the TCBs for the current (local) address space
  @TCB JOB(JES2)    +  Show the JES2 TCBs
  @TCB ASID(002C)   +  Show the TCBs for address space whose asid is '2C'
+
!Considerations
  +When using the JOB() or ASID() keywords it is possible that no data will
  +be returned even though the address space is active. This is most likely
  +because :
  +(1) The SRB scheduled into the target address space did not complete within
       five seconds. This can happen when the system load is very high.
  +(2) The SRB abended while processing the RB chain. When this happens the FRR
       that covers the SRB will recover and release the allocated storage but
       will NOT retry.
