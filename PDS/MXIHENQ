!Function
+  Displays the current Enqueue information.
+
!Command Syntax
+ @ENQ min-mask JOB(job-mask) MAJ(maj-mask) SYS(sys-mask)
+
!Keywords      +
  @min-mask      +An optional masking pattern that can be used to filter the
                 +displayed list on all or part of the minor name (rname).
                 +The wildcard character of '*' and placeholder character of '%'
                 +can be used.
                 +The default value for min-mask is '*'.
  @JOB(job-mask) +Specifies that only Enqueue information for address spaces
                 +that match the 'job-mask' pattern are to be displayed.
                 +The default value is '*'.
  @MAJ(maj-mask) +Specifies that only Enqueue information for resources with a
                 +major name that matches the 'maj-mask' pattern are to be
                 +displayed.
                 +The default value is 'SYSDSN'.
  @SYS(job-mask) +Specifies that only Enqueue information for systems that match
                 +the 'sys-mask' pattern are to be displayed.
                 +The default value is '*'.
+
!Examples
+ @ENQ                         +Show Enqueues using current defaults
+ @ENQ SYS1.*                  +Show Enqueues for all SYS1 datasets
+ @ENQ SYS1.* JOB(CIC*)        +Enqueues for all SYS1 datasets for CIC* jobs
+ @ENQ MAJ(SYSZVTOC)           +Show SYSZVTOC enqueues
+ @ENQ * MAJ(SPF*) JOB(USER%%) +SPF Enqueues for USERnn jobs
+
!Considerations
+  (1) Up to 40,000 results can be shown.
+  (2) The values for MAJ, JOB and SYS can also be changed by using the
+      appropriate@SET+command (e.g. SET JOB CICS*).
+  (3) The values passed on the MAJ, JOB and SYS keywords are active for all
+      subsequent ENQ commands until re-specified.
+
