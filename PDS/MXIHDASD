)AREA MXIHAREA
!Function
+  Displays the current online DASD volumes. The display can be directed to
+  collect data depending on either volume serial or unit address.
+
!Command Syntax
+ @DASD mask   SGRP(mask) DEVT(mask) ONLY(type) NOT(type)
+ @     U=mask
+
!Keywords      +
  @mask        +An optional masking pattern that can be used to filter the
               +displayed list on all or part of the volume serial number.
               +The default value for mask is '*'.
  @U=mask      +An optional masking pattern that can be used to filter the
               +displayed list on all or part of the unit address.
  @DEVT(mask)  +An optional masking pattern that can be used to filter the
               +displayed list on all or part of the device type.
  @SGRP(mask)  +An optional masking pattern that can be used to filter the
               +displayed list on all or part of the SMS Storage Group name.
  @ONLY(type)  +Restrict the display to only show DASD volumes of a particular
               +type:
               ¢ALLOC+= Volumes that are allocated to one or more address spaces
               ¢PAGE += Volumes that contain active page datasets
               ¢PRV  += Volumes that are mounted PRIVATE
               ¢PUB  += Volumes that are mounted PUBLIC
               ¢STO  += Volumes that are mounted STORAGE
               ¢SHR  += Volumes that are defined as SHARED
               ¢SMS  += Volumes that are defined to SMS
  @NOT(type)   +Restrict the display to not show DASD volumes of a particular
               +type:
               ¢ALLOC+= Volumes that are allocated to one or more address spaces
               ¢PAGE += Volumes that contain active page datasets
               ¢PRV  += Volumes that are mounted PRIVATE
               ¢PUB  += Volumes that are mounted PUBLIC
               ¢STO  += Volumes that are mounted STORAGE
               ¢SHR  += Volumes that are defined as SHARED
               ¢SMS  += Volumes that are defined to SMS
               ¢SPACE+= Do not collect space usage information

  +The wildcard character of '*' and a placeholder character of '%' can be used
  +in all of the masks.
+
!Examples
+ @DASD MVS%00                + List all DASD volumes MVSx00
+ @DASD U=08*                 + List all DASD units in the range 0800-08FF
+ @DASD DEVT(3380*)           + List all 3380 volumes.
+ @DASD DEVT(3390-9) NOT(SMS) + List all non-SMS 3390 Model 9 volumes.
+ @DASD * SGRP(PROD*)         + List all volumes in the SMS Storage Group 'PROD'
+ @DASD ONLY(STO)             + List all volumes mounted STORAGE
+ @DASD * ONLY(SMS) NOT(ALLOC)+ List all SMS volumes that are not allocated to
+                             + an address space.
+ @DASD NOT(SPACE)            + List all volumes but do not gather free space
                              + information using the LSPACE service.
+
+When more than one online DASD volume matches the specified pattern mask, a
+summary list of volumes is displayed.
