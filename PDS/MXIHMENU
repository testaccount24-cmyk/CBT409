)AREA MXIHAREA
!Function
+  Displays a menu of MXI commands.
+
!Command Syntax
+ $MENU cmdmask ONLY(grp) NOT(grp)
+
!Keywords
+ $cmdmask   +An optional masking pattern that can be used to filter the
+            +displayed list on all or part of the command name.
+            +A wildcard character of '*' and a placeholder character of '%'
+            +can be used.
+            +The default value for cmdmask is '*'.
+ $ONLY(grp) +Restrict the display to only show commands that belong to a
+             specific group.
+            +A wildcard character of '*' and a placeholder character of '%'
+            +can be used.
+            +The default value for grp is '*'.
             +The MXI supplied command groups are :
+            ¢DATASET  += Dataset related commands
+            ¢DB2      += DB2 related commands
+            ¢MQ       += MQSeries related commands
+            ¢MODULE   += Module related commands
+            ¢PLEX     += Commands related to sysplex issues
+            ¢RACF     += RACF related commands
+            ¢SYSTEM   += General system commands
+            ¢UNIT     += Commands related to logical or physical units
+
+ $NOT(grp)  +Restrict the display to not show commands that belong to a
+             specific group.
+            +A wildcard character of '*' and a placeholder character of '%'
+            +can be used.
             +The MXI supplied command groups are :
+            ¢DATASET  += Dataset related commands
+            ¢DB2      += DB2 related commands
+            ¢MQ       += MQSeries related commands
+            ¢MODULE   += Module related commands
+            ¢PLEX     += Commands related to sysplex issues
+            ¢RACF     += RACF related commands
+            ¢SYSTEM   += General system commands
+            ¢UNIT     += Commands related to logical or physical units
+
!Examples
+ $MENU ONLY(DB2)        +Show only DB2 commands
+ $MENU M* NOT(MQ)       +Show all commands that start with 'M' but not any
                         +that are to do with MQSeries.
+
!Considerations
+ The MENU command is the first command executed under ISPF when MXI starts.
+ To override the default "*" keyword that is passed to the MENU command on
+ startup, issue the@SET+command and change the value on the subsequent panel.
+
